- Create first pipeline to work off of.
    - Simple and only focuses on creating test cases for the files we start with.

- Updating README so it will be easy for us to follow professional standards when it comes to commits and etc.

- Trying this new pipeline format that adds this weekly security check.
    - It's new so I'm excited to see if I did it right and what I have done, so let's hope for the best. 🥰
